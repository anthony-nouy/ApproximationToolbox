% GREEDYSUBSAMPLING - Remove greedily points from a sample xn to provide a sample stable for
% least-squares approximation in the sense of [1]
%
% [xnew, deltanew] = GREEDYSUBSAMPLING(x, basis, delta)
% x: initial sample of length n
% basis: Approximation basis to build the least-squares approximation
% delta: threshold for the stability bound
% xnew: subsaample of length k <= n
% deltanew: distance beween the empirical Gram matrix computed with xnew and delta
