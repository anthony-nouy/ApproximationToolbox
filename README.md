ApproximationToolbox features low-rank tensors (including canonical, tensor-train and tree-based tensor formats), sparse tensors, polynomials, wavelets, and allows the plug-in of other approximation tools. It provides different approximation methods based on interpolation, least-squares projection, Galerkin projection or statistical learning.
